# Gap Year

Instead of rushing off to college right away, take some time to get some practical life experience first. This site hopes to arm you for the realities of the real world before you decide what to do with the rest of your life. This won't be for everyone. Are you the person who has been working since you were two to get into Yalevard? That's perfectly okay, maybe this isn't for you, or maybe it is. Take a read and decide for yourself?

## Philosophy

Taking a year after highschool before you enter college/university could be widly beneficial to you. Consider the following:

* You may be deciding on a career with no practical experience in life.
* You probably don't even know who you are yet (Spoiler: this takes a really long time, but you start to get a sense pretty early)
* You may not be emotionally mature enough for the experience of university.
* You've just spent the last twelve+ years of your life in the education system.
* College is approaching the level of financial debt like taking on a home mortgage. You should at least be sure before of what you want before you sign-up!

###You've just read things that may have assaulted your personal beliefs, you may feel resistance, but I encourage you to keep going. This isn't meant to offend you, but merely present perspectives about reality.
